# NPU Simulation Report (Draft)

## Purpose
This document will define the standardized metrics and report format for NPU
simulation runs.

Topics to cover:
- End-to-end latency (prefill, decode)
- Throughput (tokens/s, images/s)
- Resource utilization breakdowns
- Memory bandwidth and stall analysis
- Summary JSON schema for dashboards

Status:
- RTL functional simulation is implemented; performance simulator is pending.

## Next steps
- Define JSON schema and metrics fields for analytical simulation.
