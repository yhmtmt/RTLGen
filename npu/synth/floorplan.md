# NPU Floorplanning Guidance (Draft)

## Purpose
This document will define macro-level floorplanning assumptions for NPU blocks
and tiles when running OpenROAD in the devcontainer environment.

Topics to cover:
- Tile/array placement constraints
- SRAM macro placement and halo rules
- Clock/power domain partitioning
- Routing blockages and keepout guidelines
- Expected die utilization targets for block-level runs

Status:
- Placeholder; to be completed alongside OpenROAD flow.

## Next steps
- Add a baseline floorplan for the DMA tile and CQ logic.
