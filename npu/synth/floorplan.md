# NPU Floorplanning Guidance (Draft)

This document will define macro-level floorplanning assumptions for NPU blocks
and tiles when running OpenROAD in the devcontainer environment.

Topics to cover:
- Tile/array placement constraints
- SRAM macro placement and halo rules
- Clock/power domain partitioning
- Routing blockages and keepout guidelines
- Expected die utilization targets for block-level runs
